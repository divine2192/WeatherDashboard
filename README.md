# Weather Dashboard

## Overview
Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. The challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.


## Project description
* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
